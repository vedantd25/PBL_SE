                <h3>ASHA</h3>
                <p>Asha for Education is a secular organization dedicated to change in India by focusing on basic education in the belief that education is a critical requisite for socio-economic change. In keeping with this focus, our volunteers are involved with and support projects that are secular and have an education-related component to them. </p>

                <h3>Smile Foundation</h3>
                <p>Smile Foundation was initiated in 2002 when a group of friends came together with the intention of giving back to the society. They were inspired by the thought and philosophy of Peter Senge, the founder of the Society for Organizational Learning who has propagated that “sustainability, social equality and the environment are now business problems…” and corporate leaders can’t expect governments to solve them alone. </p>

                <h3>CARING HANDS</h3>
                <p>You can only hope to build a better world by improving the individuals. To that end, each one of us must work for our own improvement and at the same time share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be the most useful. This is the simplest philosophy we follow.</p>
