                <h3>Sakhya Women’s Guidance Cell</h3>

                <h3>CREA</h3>
                <p>We think sexuality is really at the frontier of women’s rights. It is a huge area through which control is wielded over our lives. It is about all of us—every woman. How I see who I see; whether I marry; how I spend my money; can I be who I really am; can I make choices; do these choices mean that I face discrimination, stigma, inequality, violence?</p>

                <h3>Make Love Not Scars (MLNS)</h3>
                <p>Make Love Not Scars, now a registered NGO, began as an idea for a documentary one year ago. The concept was simple - we wanted to make a documentary to give a voice to acid attack survivors, specifically in India.</p>
