                <h3>Animal Rahat</h3>
                <p>Animal Rahat was founded in 2003 to make a difference in the lives of working bullocks, donkeys, ponies, horses, and other animals in the Indian states of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Veterinary teams at four regional offices help thousands of animals in often desperate need, while the group’s two sanctuaries provide rescued and retired animals with a lifetime of care.</p>
